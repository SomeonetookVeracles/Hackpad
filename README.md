The hackpad for hack club highway

I'm a big man, and when I use my dinky 60% keyboard I often find that my hands wrap around to the ends of it when resting, this is obviously uncomfortable, and when combined with the fact it doesn't come with a tilda (yes, seriously, it pisses me off), I decided to make a hackpad that's more ergonomic, and with a more interesting shape than just **square**
